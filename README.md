# UsedCarPrice
Machine Learning model used to predict price of used Car based on different feature columns <br/>
Many consider to buy a Used Car intsead of buying of new one, as it's is feasible and a better investment. When you buy a New Car and sale it just another day, the price of car reduces by 30%.There are also many frauds in the market who not only sale below average cars with bad condition but also they could mislead to wrong price.
So, here I used this following dataset to Predict the price of any used car based on historical data.

Data Set 
  1. S.No. : Serial Number
  2. Name : Name of the car which includes Brand name and Model name
  3. Location : The location in which the car is being sold or is available for purchase
  4. Year : Manufacturing year of the car
  5. Kilometers_driven : The total kilometers driven in the car by the previous owner(s) in KM.
  6. Fuel_Type : The type of fuel used by the car. (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, CNG, LPG)
  7. Transmission : The type of transmission used by the car. (Automatic / Manual)
  8. Owner : Type of ownership
  9. Mileage : The standard mileage offered by the car company in kmpl or km/kg
  10. Engine : The displacement volume of the engine in CC.
  11. Power : The maximum power of the engine in bhp.
  12. Seats : The number of seats in the car.
  13. New_Price : The price of a new car of the same model in INR Lakhs.(1 Lakh = 100, 000)
  14. Price : The price of the used car in INR Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100, 000)
  
 Problem
- Does various predicating factors effect the price of the used car .?
- What all independent variables effect the pricing of used cars?
- Does name of a car have any effect on pricing of car.?
- How does type of Transmission effect pricing?
- Does Location in which the car being sold has any effect on the price?
- Does kilometers_Driven,Year of manufacturing have negative correlation with price of the car?
- Does Mileage ,Engine and Power have any effect on the pricing of the car?
- How does number of seat ,Fuel type effect the pricing.?
